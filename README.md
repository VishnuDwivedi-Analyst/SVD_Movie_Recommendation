# SVD_Movie_Recommendation
Collaborative filtering-based movie recommendation system using SVD algorithm in Python

## Objective
This project implements a collaborative filtering-based movie recommendation system using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm. It predicts user ratings and provides personalized movie suggestions from a large dataset.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Surprise Library
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Project Steps
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Loaded movies and ratings datasets
   - Handled missing values and prepared data for model training
2. **Model Building**
   - Implemented SVD algorithm using the Surprise library
   - Trained the model on user-item rating data
3. **Prediction & Recommendation**
   - Predicted ratings for users
   - Generated top movie recommendations per user
4. **Evaluation**
   - Measured model performance using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)

## Results
- Personalized movie recommendations for each user
- Example output screenshot: see `screenshots/SVD_Recommendations.png`
